I want you to build me a Domain Upgrade Finder App with the following features:

Goal

The app analyzes my domain names and finds potential buyers by checking if my domains are upgrades of businesses that already rank on Google.

Process / Workflow

Input

Upload or paste a list of domains (e.g., HoustonPlumberServices.com, AffordableConcreteServices.com).

Keyword Extraction

For each domain:

Remove TLD (.com, .net, .org).

Split the domain into keywords.

Example: houstonplumberservices.com â†’ houston plumber services.

Must handle 2-keyword or 3-keyword domains properly.

Google Search

Search the exact keyword phrase on Google (in quotes).

Collect only the first page results (top 10).

Extract Competitor Domains

From each Google result, extract the domain name / URL.

Keyword Matching

Check if all extracted keywords from my domain are present in the competitorâ€™s domain URL.

Word order does not matter, but all words must be included.

Example:

My domain: HoustonPlumberServices.com â†’ houston plumber services.

Competitor: serviceshoustonplumber.com âœ… (all keywords exist).

Upgrade Domain Check

If competitorâ€™s domain contains all keywords, mark my domain as an upgrade.

Output

Save results in a table / CSV format:

My Domain                  | Upgrade For
------------------------------------------------
HoustonPlumberServices.com | serviceshoustonplumber.com
AffordableConcreteServices.com | bestaffordableconcreteservices.net


Option to download results (CSV or Excel).

Technical Notes

The app must be fully automated.

Must respect Google scraping limits (use Google Search API or scraping library like SerpAPI, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, or Playwright).

Frontend can be simple web app (React or Next.js) or desktop app (Python with Tkinter/Streamlit).

Backend should handle:

Keyword extraction

Google search

URL parsing

Keyword matching

CSV export

Extra Features (if possible)

Show number of matches found for each domain.

Option to filter only domains with at least 1 upgrade match.

Dashboard view with progress bar while searching.

ðŸ‘‰ Deliverable: A working app where I can upload my domains, run the search, and download a list of upgrade opportunities with target websites.
